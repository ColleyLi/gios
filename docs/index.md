# GIOS

A General Interface for embedded Optimization Solvers (GIOS). It's written in C++ to:

- Naturally interact with your solver's generated code using your own data structures.
- Use the same interface across different solvers.
- Perform zero-copy solver data manipulation.

As a result, this library is highly suitable for embedded applications such as Model Predictive Control ([paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2001.08012)).
