# GIOS

GIOS is a Generalistic Interface for Optimization Solvers. Is written in C++ and allows you to interact with your solver's generated code using your own data structures and a standardized interface. With GIOS, you can select the solver to use and switch between them without changing your code. Is written in C++ and, since it links the data without storing it, is very lightweight and suitable for embedded applications like Model Predictive Control (MPC).
